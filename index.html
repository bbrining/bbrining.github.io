                <h4>About the Breed</h4>
                <p>
                    The Miniature American Shepherd resembles a small Australian Shepherd. 
                    True herders in spite of their compact size, Minis are bright, self-motivated workers and endearingly loyal and lively companion dogs who have an affinity for horses.
                    The Miniature American Shepherd shares many physical traits with its forebear the Australian Shepherd'only on a smaller scale. Females stand between 13 and 17 inches at the shoulder;
                    males range from 14 to 18 inches. Despite their size, Minis are every inch a true herding dog: energetic, versatile, rugged, and extremely bright. 
                    The eye-catching coat comes in black, blue merle, red, and red merle.(The merle will exhibit in any amount marbling, flecks, or blotches.) 
                    Minis move with the smooth and agile step of a dog built for hard work on punishing terrain.
